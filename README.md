- The Unity project is 'cleaned' and includes the `Assets` folder, the `ProjectSettings` folder, and the `UnityPackageManager` folder.

>**Note:** If for any reason you remove and re-import GVR SDK for Unity v1.100.1, make sure you accept any API update pop-up prompts triggered by Unity. Alternatively, you can manually run the API updater (Unity menu `Assets` > `Run API Updater...`) after the import has completed.

# Important Notes:
I didn't upload about 0.5GB of video assets to keep the repo size small.
you can download any video and added it in the museum as u like (and the subtitles are optional)
but here are the links to the videos I used (subtitles are already in the project):

## how to add the videos in the museum:
1_) search for VideoController in the scene view or hierarchy
2_) select any of the TVs
3_) add the videos you want in the video list (if any video has a subtitle it has to be in the same index as the video)

P.S. for the subtitles I used [this site to transfer them to TimedText1.0 (.xml/.ttml)](https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter)
