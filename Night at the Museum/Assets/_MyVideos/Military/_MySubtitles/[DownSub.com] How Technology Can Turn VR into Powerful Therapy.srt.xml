      <p begin="102.902s" id="p43" end="105.092s">essential for delivering good VR.</p>
      <p begin="105.092s" id="p44" end="106.836s">With the technology getting better,</p>
      <p begin="106.836s" id="p45" end="108.801s">computers have gotten faster, and you know,</p>
      <p begin="108.801s" id="p46" end="111.005s">things like some of the<br />latest Intel processors,</p>

      <p begin="113.183s" id="p48" end="114.677s">And so, that's why we can deliver VR</p>
      <p begin="114.677s" id="p49" end="118.001s">that can make a difference<br />in people's lives.</p>

      <p begin="127.967s" id="p54" end="129.868s">for the rest of their life.</p>
      <p begin="129.868s" id="p55" end="132.046s">- So I'm setting a new path for myself.</p>

      <p begin="135.875s" id="p58" end="137.273s">I jumped ahead to a masters</p>
      <p begin="137.273s" id="p59" end="139.042s">and a doctorate program yesterday.</p>
      <p begin="139.042s" id="p60" end="141.325s">I have five years ahead of<br />me, and a whole lifetime</p>
      <p begin="141.325s" id="p61" end="143.279s">ahead of that to hopefully<br />help as many people as I can.</p>
      <p begin="143.279s" id="p62" end="146.029s">And go to school and help others.</p>

      <p begin="150.279s" id="p64" end="154.345s">that's going to change<br />everything about how we learn,</p>

      <p begin="158.278s" id="p66" end="160.417s">that we could never go to.</p>
      <p begin="160.417s" id="p67" end="164.024s">The cool thing is that these<br />are really consumer products</p>
      <p begin="164.024s" id="p68" end="165.842s">everyone will have one in their home,</p>
      <p begin="165.842s" id="p69" end="168.377s">and the advanced level of<br />processing that we're getting</p>
      <p begin="168.377s" id="p70" end="170.779s">allows everyone to be<br />able to buy a computer</p>
      <p begin="170.779s" id="p71" end="173.355s">that'll run a state of the art VR headset</p>
      <p begin="173.355s" id="p72" end="175.254s">and you'll be able to consume media</p>
      <p begin="175.254s" id="p73" end="177.406s">in dramatically new ways.</p>
      <p begin="177.406s" id="p74" end="181.312s">There's so much value<br />beyond just entertainment,</p>
      <p begin="181.312s" id="p75" end="184.852s">to use the power of this<br />technology to help people,</p>
